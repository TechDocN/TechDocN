Hello
- I probably should have been an engineer, but I went to medical school instead.
- In my spare time I am a serious tinkerer.
- I’m interested in electronics, microcontrollers, SBCs, robotics, coding, 3D printing and retro-computing.
- I’m currently putting the finishing touches on my first cyberDeck.
- I plan to start documenting my projects here.
