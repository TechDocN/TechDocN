Hello
- I am a physician and I work in the MedTech industry.
- In my spare time I am a serious tinkerer.
- I’m interested in electronics, microcontrollers, SBCs, robotics, coding, 3D printing and vintage/retro-computing.
- I’m currently restoring an original Commodore PET 2001-8.
- My current vintage-computing collection* (as of 27 March 2025):
    - 1 Commodore PET 2001
    - 1 TRS-80 Model 1 (16K Level II, with Quinnterface** upgrade to 48K and FreHD** SD card mass storage device)
    - 1 Apple II+ (16K upgraded to 48K + 16K on language card = 64K, one 5.25" floppy and an XDrive** SD/flash mass storage card)
    - 2 TRS-80 Color Computer Model 1s (one 16K, one 64K with white case and "melted" keyboard)
    - 3 TRS-80 Color Computer Model 2s (all three 64K, one w/"deluxe" keyboard and upgraded VDG, two CoCoSDC** SD mass storage cartridges. one Fujinet**)
    - 1 Tandy Color Computer Model 3 (128K upgraded to 512K**)
    - 1 TRS-80 MC-10 Micro Color Computer (with OEM 16K memory upgrade cardtridge)
    - 1 TRS-80 Model 100
    - 1 Tandy Model 102 (with REX#** flash memory mass storage)
    - 1 Tandy Model 200 (with REX#** flash memory mass storage)
    - 1 Timex/Sinclair 1000 (with OEM 16K memory upgrade cardtridge)
    - 1 Tandy 1000EX (with 640K memory upgrade and CF mass storage 3in1 Expansion Card**)
 
*All of these vintage computers are in perfect, or near perfect working condition, with the exception of the Commodore PET. It is being actively restored and is not currently operational.

**These modern upgrades were added by me. Most are still available because of the admirable work of so many in the vintage and retro computing communities.
