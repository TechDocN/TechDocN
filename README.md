Hello
- I am a physician and I work in the MedTech industry.
- In my spare time I am a serious tinkerer.
- I’m interested in electronics, microcontrollers, SBCs, robotics, coding, 3D printing and retro-computing.
- I’m currently learning about Fujinet for the CoCo.
- My current retro-computing collection: 1 CoCo1, 3 CoCo2s, 1 CoCo3, 1 TRS-80 Model 100, 1 Tandy Model 102, 1 Timex/Sinclair 100, and I am in the market for a Tandy 1000EX.
